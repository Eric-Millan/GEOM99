<!-- PAGE EXPLANATION -->
<div class="intro">
	<h1 class="headerText">Final Web Solution</h1>
	<p class="headerText2"> The results of this project was the creation of two web solutions capable of displaying public safety resources for public use. 
		These solutions are displayed in a single environment through the use of ESRI Experience Builder which allows the user to select between solutions 
		to fit their needs.</p>
</div>


<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Introduction </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Being able to provide easily accessible open data at the neighborhood level in Toronto has directed the Toronto Police Service to develop a single web mapping application known as the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN). In order to accomplish this, a few solutions were developed as initial developments to allow the clients to observe how the web mapping solution will work and operate. Two solutions were developed as prototypes which include an ArcGIS Dashboard and a Geocortex 5 solution, both which are hosted in a single environment via the Web App Builder. In both solutions, essential services information is displayed including hospital, police, and fire facilities across Toronto neighbourhoods. Moreover, a user guide is in development that will allow the client to understand and utilize it for future projects. Arcade programming is another essential component of our solution as it was used to configure information in our Dashboards, specifically when formatting the pop-ups. Other relevant information is also included such as demographics, population, counsellor, etc. Initially, Geocortex 5 was the main solution and format to display our project however after advisor, client, and group meetings it was decided to include a Dashboard as well primarily due to its user-friendliness, configurability, and suitability for this project in particular.  </p>
</div>
	
<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Meeting our Problem Statement </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Based on what was accomplished as of now, our solutions do meet what was stated in our initial problem statement. We discussed in our problem statement that our ideal solution will be a web map solution that can be used by public and professional users in which public safety services at the neighborhood level can be queried. Both Geocortex 5 and Dashboard solutions allow this as public safety services such as fire, police, and medical facilities can be viewed and used at the neighborhood level in Toronto. A main issue that the TPS had initially was how users had to use numerous web map solutions to view data with none of them being at the neighborhood level. 
Our solutions remove previous consequences posed by the previous applications, as our solution displays all relevant public safety information in a single application (neighbourhood-based) so user can view their data in their respective neighborhood and know that they are getting the appropriate information. </p>
</div>
	
<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Future Possibilities, Implementations and Projects </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">From our project, there are a lot of potential in terms of future possibilities and directions where it can be taken. If tested and noted to be used effectively well, other municipalities police services can also make use of the same model as we used for our solution. From using Geocortex 5 to effectively display historical data and information as well as using Dashboards to display current data. Even just using the Geocortex 5 and Dashboards technology can be very beneficial for regional police services across Ontario. It would be ideal for every regional police to make use of the same or similar web application model as that can allow for more transparency and data/information sharing between municipalities. Furthermore, this technology and model can assist in improving communication to the public and other relevant stakeholders such as other regional officers, public users, and professional users. Moreover, an implementation guide that we will developed can be referenced so that the same solutions can be created if anything. The use of ESRI technology such as Geocortex 5 and Dashboards have been pivotal as of recent, as more and more users and approaching these platforms as effective manners to display their data and information. For instance, the York Regional Police also made use of Geocortex 5 Analytics to accurately monitor the health of their multi-server environment and communicate how they are managing this to upper management.  </p>
</div>
	<p class = "generalText">The work that was completed in this project has many applications in future projects. For one, we have learned how to use and work with additional ESRI products - ArcGIS Dashboards and Geocortex 5. These solutions are both products that are used extensively in the geospatial world and being able to learn how to use them is beneficial in our careers. Moreover, being able to use the ArcGIS Web App Builder is another product that we have worked with and made use of as well as ArcGIS Arcade programming which was sued to configure the pop-ups in the web map solutions. Furthermore, additional skills that were gained during the course of our project as of now is something that we will take into going forward in our respective career. This includes better project management, organization, and communication skills. Moreover, working with these products (Dashboards, Geocortex 5, Web-App Builder) provides us with more knowledge and expertise which then allows us to be able to choose these solutions as an effective option whenever a certain issue/problem arises. This extends past working with police services as the use of Dashboards have been used throughout various industries such as the John Hopkins COVID-19 map. The same can be said for Geocortex 5, Web App Builder and Arcade programming. Working with these products also allowed to gain better understanding of ESRI products and the potential that they have across various industries. </p>
