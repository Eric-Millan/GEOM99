<!-- PAGE EXPLANATION -->
<div class="intro">
	<h1 class="headerText">Final Web Solution</h1>
	<p class="headerText2"> The results of this project was the creation of two web solutions capable of displaying public safety resources for public use. 
		These solutions are displayed in a single environment through the use of ESRI Experience Builder which allows the user to select between solutions 
		to fit their needs.</p>

<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Introduction </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Being able to provide easily accessible open data at the neighborhood level in Toronto has directed the Toronto Police Service (TPS) to develop a single web mapping solution known as the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) application. In order to accomplish this, a Geocortex 5 and Dashboards solutions were developed as initial developments to allow the clients to observe how the web mapping solution will operate. These solutions were developed as prototypes and are both hosted in a single web environment via the ArcGIS Experience Builder. In both solutions, public safety service data and information is displayed such as medical, law enforcement, and fire facilities across neighborhoods and police divisions in Toronto. </p>
		
</div>
	
<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Meeting our Problem Statement </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Based on what was accomplished as of now, our solutions do meet what was stated in our problem statement. We discussed in our problem statement that our ideal product will be a web map solution that can be used by genral and advanced users in which public safety services at the neighborhood level can be queried. Both Geocortex 5 and Dashboard solutions allow this as public safety service information and data can be viewed and used at the neighborhood level in Toronto. A main issue that the TPS had initially was how users had to use numerous web map solutions to view data with none of them being at the neighborhood level. Our solutions remove these issues posed by the previous applications, as our solution displays all relevant public safety information in a single hosted enivornment so users can view their data in their respective neighborhood division and know that they are getting the appropriate information. </p>

</div>
	
<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Future Possibilities & Implementations</h1>
	<p class = "generalText">For our project, there is potential shown in terms of future possibilities and directions where it can be taken. If tested and noted to be used effectively well, other police services in different municipalities in Ontario can also make use of the same model as we used for our solution. From using Geocortex 5 to effectively display historical data and information as well as using Dashboards to display current year to date data. Moreover, it would be ideal for every regional police to make use of a similar web application model as that can allow for more transparency and data/information sharing between municipalities.</p>
