<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class ="intro-1">
	<h2> Introduction </h2>
	<p class = "generalText">The emphasis on both providing open data and shifting to community-centric policing has led the TPS to the decision to develop a web solution called Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN), which is intended to be a one-stop-shop for public safety data. This application is meant to depend heavily on geographic data and should be allow data filtering to the neighbourhood level. The major goal of this project was to provide a customized web mapping solution that will allow professional and public users to simply access and make use of the City of Toronto’s open crime data for their own needs at the neighborhood level, and being able to derive information regarding their community. Moreover, a guide is in development that will be created in order to allow the client to understand and utilize it for future projects. For our project as of now, two main solutions were produced as prototypes to meet the TPS requirements and act as an initial development of the final product. These are two web mapping solutions in the format of ESRI’s ArcGIS Dashboards and Geocortex 5. ESRI Dashboards was chosen as an optional web solution for this project due to its intuitive, easy to navigate interface and ease of use for new or inexperienced users. Geocortex 5 was a major component of our entire project and was discussed with the TPS that it would be used primarily in the display of historical data (from the TPS). Both solutions were hosted in a single environment through ESRI’s ArcGIS WebApp Builder in which both solutions can be viewed and worked with. Furthermore, ArcGIS Arcade programming was used to configure the web map configurations in Dashboards to display relevant data and information in the pop-ups. </p>

<div class ="intro-2">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Meeting our Problem Statement </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Our solution meets what was stated in the problem statement.  We discussed how the ideal solution would essentially be a web mapping tool used by the Toronto public which allows them to link with any public safety services in their neighbourhood. Both of our web mapping solutions allow this to occur as the public and relevant shareholders are able to view and make use of the tool. Moreover, this will mitigate the issue of the reality which explains how users need to make use of numerous web map applications with none of them being neighbourhood centric, compared to our solutions which are and allows users to access public safety resources. Our solutions take remove previous consequences posed by the previous applications, as our solution displays all relevant public safety information in a single application which is neighbourhood-based so every user can view their data in their respective data and know that they are getting the appropriate information. Moreover, our solution for both Dashboards and Geocortex 5 which can be viewed together through Web App Builder are combined in a single web mapping application (though are separate solutions) and displays neighborhood information including police facilities, medical centers, and fire hall facilities. It can safe to say that the solutions we created do meet the outlines of our problem statement.  </p>

<div class ="intro-3">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Future Possibilities & Implementations </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">From our project, there are a lot of potential in terms of future possibilities and directions where it can be taken. If tested and noted to be used effectively well, other municipalities police services can also make use of the same model as we used for our solution. From using Geocortex 5 to effectively display historical data and information as well as using Dashboards to display current data. Even just using the Geocortex 5 and Dashboards technology can be very beneficial for regional police services across Ontario. It would be ideal for every regional police to make use of the same or similar web application model as that can allow for more transparency and data/information sharing between municipalities. Furthermore, this technology and model can assist in improving communication to the public and other relevant stakeholders such as other regional officers, public users, and professional users. Moreover, an implementation guide that we will developed can be referenced so that the same solutions can be created if anything. The use of ESRI technology such as Geocortex 5 and Dashboards have been pivotal as of recent, as more and more users and approaching these platforms as effective manners to display their data and information. For instance, the York Regional Police also made use of Geocortex 5 Analytics to accurately monitor the health of their multi-server environment and communicate how they are managing this to upper management.  </p>

<div class ="intro-4">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Future Projects </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">The work that was completed in this project has many applications in future projects. For one, we have learned how to use and work with additional ESRI products - ArcGIS Dashboards and Geocortex 5. These solutions are both products that are used extensively in the geospatial world and being able to learn how to use them is beneficial in our careers. Moreover, being able to use the ArcGIS Web App Builder is another product that we have worked with and made use of as well as ArcGIS Arcade programming which was sued to configure the pop-ups in the web map solutions. Furthermore, additional skills that were gained during the course of our project as of now is something that we will take into going forward in our respective career. This includes better project management, organization, and communication skills. Moreover, working with these products (Dashboards, Geocortex 5, Web-App Builder) provides us with more knowledge and expertise which then allows us to be able to choose these solutions as an effective option whenever a certain issue/problem arises. This extends past working with police services as the use of Dashboards have been used throughout various industries such as the John Hopkins COVID-19 map. The same can be said for Geocortex 5, Web App Builder and Arcade programming. Working with these products also allowed to gain better understanding of ESRI products and the potential that they have across various industries. </p>
