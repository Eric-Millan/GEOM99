<!-- PAGE EXPLANATION -->
<div class="intro">
	<h1 class="headerText">Final Web Solution</h1>
	<p class="headerText2"> The results of this project was the creation of two web solutions capable of displaying public safety resources for public use. 
		These solutions are displayed in a single environment through the use of ESRI Experience Builder which allows the user to select between solutions 
		to fit their needs.</p>
</div>


<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Introduction </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Being able to provide easily accessible open data at the neighborhood level in Toronto has directed the Toronto Police Service (TPS) to develop a single web mapping solution known as the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) application. In order to accomplish this, a Geocortex 5 and Dashboards solutions were developed as initial developments to allow the clients to observe how the web mapping solution will operate. These solutions were developed as prototypes and are both hosted in a single web environment via the ArcGIS Experience Builder. In both solutions, public safety service data and information is displayed such as medical, law enforcement, and fire facilities across neighborhoods and police divisions in Toronto. </p>
		
	<p class = "generalText"> Moreover, a user guide is in development that will allow the clients to understand the implementation, design and the development of the web mapping solution and use it for future projects. Arcade programming is another essential component to our solution as it was used to configure and display relevant information in our Dashboards, specifically when formatting the pop-ups. Other information displayed includes the demographics, population, counsellor and more for each neighborhood.</p>

<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Meeting our Problem Statement </h1>
	<p class = "generalText">Based on what was accomplished as of now, our solutions do meet what was stated in our problem statement. We discussed in our problem statement that our ideal product will be a web map solution that can be used by genral and advanced users in which public safety services at the neighborhood level can be queried. Both Geocortex 5 and Dashboard solutions allow this as public safety services such as fire, police, and medical facilities can be viewed and used at the neighborhood level in Toronto. A main issue that the TPS had initially was how users had to use numerous web map solutions to view data with none of them being at the neighborhood level. 
Our solutions remove these issues posed by the previous applications, as our solution displays all relevant public safety information in a single hosted enivornment so users can view their data in their respective neighborhood and know that they are getting the appropriate information. </p>

<div class ="block1">
	<h1 class = "title4"> Future Possibilities & Implementations</h1>
	<p class = "generalText">For our project, there is potential shown in terms of future possibilities and directions where it can be taken. If tested and noted to be used effectively well, other police services in different municipalities in Ontario can also make use of the same model as we used for our solution. From using Geocortex 5 to effectively display historical data and information as well as using Dashboards to display current year to date data. Moreover, it would be ideal for every regional police to make use of a similar web application model as that can allow for more transparency and data/information sharing between municipalities.</p> 
		
	<p class = "generalText">Furthermore, this technology and model can assist in improving communication to the public and other relevant stakeholders such as other regional officers, public users, and professional users. An implementation guide that is in development can be referenced so that similar solutions can be created if anything. The use of ESRI technology such as Geocortex 5 and Dashboards have been pivotal as of recent, as more and more users and approaching these platforms as effective manners to display their data and information. For instance, the York Regional Police made use of Geocortex 5 Analytics to precisely monitor the health of their multi-server environment and communicate it to upper management.  </p>

	</div>
	
	<p class = "generalText">The work that was completed in this project has many applications for future projects. For one, we have learned how to use and work with additional ESRI products such as Experience Builder, Dashboards and Geocortex 5. These solutions are both products that are used extensively in the geospatial world and being able to learn how to use them is beneficial in our careers. Moreover, being able to utilize Arcade programming to configure and format information shown in the pop-ups in Dashboards is a useful skill that we all definitely can make use of in the future. Additional skills that were gained during the course of our project as of now is something that we will take into going forward in our respective career. </p>
		<p class = "generalText">This includes better project management, organization, and technical skills. Working with these products provide us with more knowledge and expertise, allowing us to be able to choose these solutions as an effective option whenever a certain issue/problem arises. Working with these products also allowed to gain better understanding of ESRI products and the potential that they have across various industries. This extends past working with police services as the use of Dashboards has numerous applications in different sectors such as the John Hopkins COVID-19 map and the same can be said for Geocortex 5, Web App Builder and Arcade programming.  </p>
