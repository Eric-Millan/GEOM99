	<h1 class="title4"> Introduction </h1>

		<p class ="generalText"> Both mapping solutions were created using Geocortex 5, Experience Builder, Arcade and Dashboards containing neighborhoods of Toronto and relevant public service information such as hospital facilities, fire halls and police stations. Arcade programming was used to configure the pop-ups in the Dashboard environment as well as using the Experience Builder to host both solutions in a single environment. Other meaningful information is displayed within each neighborhood such as population, demographics and census information and these solutions will be shared to the clients, general public and professional users.  </p>

<!-- ARCADE -->

<div class="block1">
	<p class="title4"><a id="arcadeSection" > Arcade and Web Map Pop-Up Configuration: </a></p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Arcade is an in house ESRI programming language which can handle 
			lightweight expressions across a wide range of products including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS 
			Runtime and ArcGIS Online. It allows developers to create expressions which interact 
			with datasets and their geographic qualities. Functions such as “intersect” allows a 
			developer to create relationships between datasets based on their geographic quality. 
			Since it is likely that our group will be using this language to some extent in our 
			collaborative project, it was explored as part of our Public Safety Web Solution. </p>
	</div>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Initial Set-up and Configuration:</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="ESRI Dashboard" src="images/arcadeimages/arcade_1.JPG">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Navigating to the Web Map Pop Up Expression Manager</p>

	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Arcade can be applied in many different ESRI products, but to be 
			targeted in our approach, we worked almost exclusively in the web map pop-up environment. 
			Our web solution consists of polygons representing the neighborhoods of Toronto, ON and 
			points representing public safety resources (health facilities, fire departments and police 
			stations). Our objective was to show information about these services within the pop-up 
			window for each neighborhood. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="ESRI Dashboard" src="images/arcadeimages/arcade_2.JPG">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Navigating to the Web Map Pop Up Expression Manager</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">To Access the pop-up expression manager, you click on the layer 
			whose popup will be customized (1) and the click on the configure pop-ups button (2). 
			At this screen, you are presented with several options to customize the content within 
			your pop-up window. We will return to this screen at the end of the process, but first 
			we need to build some expressions. If we click on manage expressions (3) and add expression 
			(4) we can begin to write some Arcade Code. </p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="ESRI Dashboard" src="images/arcadeimages/arcade_3.JPG">
	</div>
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Expression Manager and Sample Code</p>
		<p class="generalText">In this example code, I want the Arcade expression to return all of 
			the names of health services, within the neighborhood polygon that is clicked on to generate 
			the popup. This particular expression uses the intersect function to return only the records 
			which are within a polygon, and then iterates through each record and creates an array 
			(essentially an Arcade version of a list) of these location names. It then returns this 
			array as an output. This is one of several code expressions which run behind the scenes 
			whenever a pop-up is generated. </p>

		<p class="generalText">Finally, to configure the popup we return to the configure pop-ups screen 
			and navigate to out text field. In this environment, we can create basic design choices (color, 
			font, etc) and insert the name of the code expressions we want as a form of dynamic tests. 
			The expression we built previously for Health Service names is represented by {expression/expr6}. 
			When we save at this screen and open a popup, we now see a list of the health services within 
			the neighborhood presented in an easy-to-read format. </p>

		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">An examlpe of a customized popup</p>
	</div>
		
		<p class="generalText">Arcade is a lightweight language which can perform simple tasks in a web 
			environment, and there is a lot more to explore when it comes to chart design and different 
			functions, however for many applications, it is a good tool to create new ways to understand 
			and explore data. </p>

		<p class = homeSubHead>Challenges Along the Way:</p>
		<p class="generalText">Arcade was a new language for us to understand, so there was a bit of a 
			steep learning curve on the different data types it can produce (not exactly like python or 
			JavaScript). For example, adding items to an array includes having an index number associated 
			with it and this concept took some time to understand.  </p>

		<p class="generalText">Because it is an ESRI specific language, there is a lack of documentation 
			online or good example of effective deployment, and ESRI produced videos could either be very 
			simple (eg. “we have a new language called arcade”) or very complex (“this is the backend 
			development for Arcade, everyone here is an expert programmer right?”). We were able to create 
			some simple expression, but with time, we believe this could be a powerful tool in dashboard 
			customization. </p>

		<p class="generalText">One challenge which we’d like to resolve is the ability to create summary 
			statistics between layers, as this would be important for our collaborative project and was not 
			something we were able to create.</p>

		<p class = homeSubHead>Future Directions:</p>
		<p class="generalText">As we develop our collaborative project with the TPS, we will make use of 
			Arcade Expressions and determine what type of data can be manipulated with it. It has the ability 
			to manipulate visualization and data, so we would like to explore creative different map symbology. 
			Creating summary statistics with the intersect tool is also something which will be important for 
			our final project. For example, it would be great if we were able to show previous year crime 
			statistics side by side with current year and current trajectory. We would also like to explore 
			the custom symbology side of things, such as being able to manipulate the colors used in charts.</p>

<!-- DASHBOARDS -->

<div class="block1">
    <p class="title4"><a id="dashboardSection" > ESRI Dashboard: </a></p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> ESRI Dashboards was chosen as an optional web solution for this project due to its intuitive, easy to navigate interface 
			and ease of use for new or inexperienced users. Dashboard's capacity to provide on-the-fly data summaries in the form of counts, graphs, and lists 
			provide a wealth of information with no additional information input required from the users.</p>
	</div>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Initial Set-up and Configuration:</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="Unconfigured ESRI Dashboard" src="images/dashboardFig1.jpg">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Basic Dashboard set-up and design of widgets prior to the introduction of configuration. 
		All widgets in image were brought in, resized, and placed within the frame.
	</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> The first set in setting up the dashboard environment involved adding the web map, 
			complete with Arcade pop-up expressions, into the solution. For this project, the web map formed the 
			basis upon which all other Dashboard widgets were based.  </p>

		<p class="generalText"> With the main map added to the Dashboard frame, various widgets could then be added. 
			In dashboards these widgets allow for various aspects of the map layer data to be displayed as lists, graphs 
			or charts, or various data summaries. In addition to map layer-based widgets, you can also add various 
			layout-based items such as text, images, and embedded content. This ability to configure the Dashboard 
			solution provides nearly unlimited options for how to display your data. </p>

		<p class="generalText"> With the widgets added and configured to show the relevant data it was then possible 
			to sync the widgets to the map frame using map actions. The map actions allow the widgets to automatically 
			adjust their information when the map is scaled so that new statistics, counts, and information are 
			presented for the viewable extent. The map frame, and neighbourhood list/dropdown can then be configured 
			using layer actions so that when the user selects a desired neighbourhood the Dashboard will zoom to that 
			area and display the neighbourhood pop-up window. </p>

		<img class="projectimage" alt="Configuration Options in ESRI Dashboard" src="images/dashboardFig2.jpg">
	</div>
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Screenshots showing the various configuration options and windows 
			available in the Dashboards environment.</p>
		<p class = homeSubHead> Challenges Along the Way:</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> Early development of the Dashboard was completed using a draft web map. 
			The shortcoming of this were not realized until later in the project when a final revised web map was 
			completed and ready to be integrated into the final Dashboard configuration. As all widgets are 
			configured to work in relation the layers present in the web map, switching to a new web map requires 
			that all widgets be reconfigured to the new layers. For this project, the limited number of widgets 
			meant this was not a difficult task, however more complicated Dashboards could require significant 
			alteration. This could result in issues for future development as some configurations may be missed 
			or linked incorrectly. This realization underlines the importance of having a proper base upon 
			which to work and the teamwork involved in developing a solution together rather than in separate 
			pieces. In addition to this, the process also highlighted the importance of having well maintained, 
			organized, and presented data within the original web map prior to developing the Dashboard as the 
			solution is a means of visualizing and displaying the data and can only be as good as the data allows. </p>

		<p class="generalText"> Throughout the process of developing the Dashboard solution is also became clear 
			that while this solution is the ideal platform for general users, it does limit the developer by 
			only allowing for those tools/processes that are within the dashboard to be implemented. This did not 
			limit the current project, however, should a more advanced web solution leveraging higher level 
			geoprocessing be required the Dashboard solution may not be optimal. </p>
	</div>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Future Directions:</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="Configured ESRI Dashboard" src="images/dashboards.png">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Dashboard following configuration to allow widget and main map to 
		interact. Colour and design elements were also brought in to create a uniform presentation.</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> This project served as an excellent introduction to dashboard and its capabilities. 
			Future work will look to integrate a more robust assessment of layer data that was not available in 
			the current data set. This will allow for the use of charts, graphs, and gauges. Additional exploration 
			of how embedded content can be used to expand beyond the capabilities of Dashboard by allowing for 
			external content to be brought into the Dashboard environment should also be explored. Exploring these 
			options further will allow for a more robust and meaningful presentation of data. </p>

<!-- GEOCORTEX -->

<div class="block1">
	<p class="title4"><a id="geocortexSection" > Geocortex HTML5 Web Viewer: </a></p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Geocortex 5 Web was chosen as our initial solution for our problem based on our understanding of the platform being 
			an enhanced method to display Esri web maps with greater options of customization (admittedly, our understanding of Geocortex as a whole 
			was very limited prior to our development work). Additionally, Geocortex products are an important aspect of our collaborative project which 
			also factored in to why it was chosen so that we may gain valuable experience. </p>
	</div>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Initial Set-up and Configuration:</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="Geocortex Layout" src="images\geocortexlayout.PNG">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Geocortex Web layout desgin.</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Prior to developing the Geocortex solution, we first created a basic vision of our desired layout. After the creation of the 
			basic web map for integration with the application, Geocortex Web development could begin. </p>
		<p class="generalText">Layout design and configuration was achieved by selecting and dragging components into the layout pane. The basic structure, 
			or arrangement of the layout is created by adding Columns, Rows, Tabs, and Panels which are termed “Layout Components”. The sizing, control over 
			sizing, and visibility can all be configured for each component added.</p>
		<p class="generalText">During Layout Component placement, we concurrently added “Map Components”. These are the features that relate to interactivity 
			and exploration of the map as the name suggests. Several Map Components are available, however, only a portion were used based on the needs as defined 
			by the problem statement. Similar to the Layout Components, each Map Component can be configured but with added functionality in the form of Feature Actions. 
			Feature Actions are what occurs after features in the map are identified (i.e results). These are pre-defined by Geocortex but do provide the option for 
			modification (although no modifications were made in our solution; see Challenges section). For each Map Component added, Feature Actions were added/removed 
			accordingly.</p>
		<p class="generalText">After we achieved a layout complete with Feature Actions we were happy with, the final step was to test the application from the perspective 
			of a user. This was important in identifying where certain functionality was not working as intended to direct further work and modification.</p>
	</div>

	<p class = homeSubHead>Challenges Along the Way:</p>

	<div>
		<p class="generalText">One of the first challenges we encountered was what we considered to be a lack of available documentation to aid with development. Help 
			documentation that we have come to expect for Esri products are in stark contrast to what we were able to find for Geocortex. This presented us with the challenge 
			of having to rely more on experimentation to develop a stronger understanding.</p>
		<p class="generalText">Although this was a relatively minor challenge, even just learning how to utilize components in creating the layout was a challenging at first. 
			The process of dragging components to the layout pane, learning how the hierarchy of rows and columns worked, and configuring their sizes and visibility took some 
			time to become comfortable with. We also encountered a bug which prevented the map component (arguably the most important one) from allowing us to select a map! 
			This bug occurs (in v5.5) when a blank layout is created, but we were fortunate to find forum confirming that this was indeed a bug and that a workaround existed 
			(delete all components except for the map component from one of the default layout options).</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Geocortex Command Example" src="images\geocortexfeatureaction.PNG">
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">An example Command, viewing the custom command design interface for the default pre-configured Draw command.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Utilizing Feature Actions was source of major time investment. As mentioned, going into development we had little knowledge of Geocortex. Initially, 
			we assumed that Feature Actions would have the ability to customize many different aspects of interacting with features such as customizing drawn polygon colours, the 
			attributes that display when a feature is selected, etc. We gathered as much documentation as we find on this topic (some of the best resources ended up being short 
			YouTube videos produced by Geocortex), which certainly helped, but did not answer all of our questions.</p>
		<p class="generalText">It became clear to us that to achieve some of the functionality we had envisioned would require the use of Workflows. As we began researching how to 
			utilize Workflows, it also became clear that this would not be a simple task. Our problem statement did not call for the explicit use of Workflows, and we therefore did 
			not budget enough time to effectively learn an implement this aspect in to our solution.</p>
		<p class="generalText">Lastly, we encountered issues with how certain attributes controlled by arcade expression in the web map displayed in Geocortex. For example, an 
			expression that counts the number of features within a neighbourhood polygon and then displays the result in a popup when the feature is identified did not work in 
			Geocortex. Again, we were not able to find documentation to assist us with this problem, thus the issue still exists in our solution.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage2" alt="Geocortex Error Arcade" src="images\geocortexarcadeerror.PNG">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">An example failing of web map arcade expressions in Geocortex Web.</p>

	<p class = homeSubHead>Future Directions:</p>

	<div>
		<p class="generalText">Our development work in Geocortex Web has shown us the difficulty that comes when you cannot rely on copious sources of documentation and guides. 
			Geocortex can provide so much more than what we produced but will require us to invest significantly more time into exploration and testing to be able to capitalize on it. 
			A good first step will be to dedicate ample time to learning how to implement Workflows, beginning with a relatively simple example and building our knowledge and experience 
			from there.</p>
