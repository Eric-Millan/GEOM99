<!-- DASHBOARDS -->

<div class="block1">
    <p class="title4"><a id="dashboardSection" > ESRI Dashboard: </a></p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> ESRI Dashboards was chosen as an optional web solution for this project due to its intuitive, easy to navigate interface 
			and ease of use for new or inexperienced users. Dashboard's capacity to provide on-the-fly data summaries in the form of counts, graphs, and lists 
			provide a wealth of information with no additional information input required from the users.</p>
	</div>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Initial Set-up and Configuration:</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage" alt="Unconfigured ESRI Dashboard" src="images/dashboardFig1.jpg">
	</div>
	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Figure 1: ESRI Dashboard showing example of configuration pane.</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> The first set in setting up the dashboard environment involved adding the web map, 
			complete with Arcade pop-up expressions, into the solution. For this project, the web map formed the 
			basis upon which all other Dashboard widgets were based.  </p>

		<p class="generalText"> With the main map added to the Dashboard frame, various widgets could then be added. 
			In dashboards these widgets allow for various aspects of the map layer data to be displayed as lists, graphs 
			or charts, or various data summaries. In addition to map layer-based widgets, you can also add various 
			layout-based items such as text, images, and embedded content. This ability to configure the Dashboard 
			solution provides nearly unlimited options for how to display your data. </p>

		<p class="generalText"> With the widgets added and configured to show the relevant data it was then possible 
			to sync the widgets to the map frame using map actions. The map actions allow the widgets to automatically 
			adjust their information when the map is scaled so that new statistics, counts, and information are 
			presented for the viewable extent. The map frame, and neighbourhood list/dropdown can then be configured 
			using layer actions so that when the user selects a desired neighbourhood the Dashboard will zoom to that 
			area and display the neighbourhood pop-up window. </p>

		<p class = homeSubHead> Challenges Along the Way:</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> Early development of the Dashboard was completed using a draft web map. 
			The shortcoming of this were not realized until later in the project when a final revised web map was 
			completed and ready to be integrated into the final Dashboard configuration. As all widgets are 
			configured to work in relation the layers present in the web map, switching to a new web map requires 
			that all widgets be reconfigured to the new layers. For this project, the limited number of widgets 
			meant this was not a difficult task, however more complicated Dashboards could require significant 
			alteration. This could result in issues for future development as some configurations may be missed 
			or linked incorrectly. This realization underlines the importance of having a proper base upon 
			which to work and the teamwork involved in developing a solution together rather than in separate 
			pieces. In addition to this, the process also highlighted the importance of having well maintained, 
			organized, and presented data within the original web map prior to developing the Dashboard as the 
			solution is a means of visualizing and displaying the data and can only be as good as the data allows. </p>

		<p class="generalText"> Throughout the process of developing the Dashboard solution is also became clear 
			that while this solution is the ideal platform for general users, it is does limit the developer by 
			only allowing for those tools/processes that are within the dashboard to be implemented. This did not 
			limit the current project, however, should a more advanced web solution leveraging higher level 
			geoprocessing be required the Dashboard solution may not be optimal. </p>

	<p class = homeSubHead> Future Directions:</p>

	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Figure 1: Blah blah blah.</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText"> This project served as an excellent introduction to dashboard and its capabilities. 
			Future work will look to integrate a more robust assessment of layer data that was not available in 
			the current data set. This will allow for the use of charts, graphs, and gauges. Additional exploration 
			of how embedded content can be used to expand beyond the capabilities of Dashboard by allowing for 
			external content to be brought into the Dashboard environment should also be explored. Exploring these 
			options further will allow for a more robust and meaningful presentation of data. </p>
