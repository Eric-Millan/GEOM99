<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Problem Statement</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Ideal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> A web map tool for the Toronto public which connects them to public safety resources in their neighbourhood. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Reality </p>
	<p class="generalText"> The public currently needs to use mutliple web map applications, none of which are neighbourhood-centric, to access the various public safety resources which may be confusing to the user or incomplete. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Consequences </p>
	<p class="generalText"> When people don't know what resources are available in their community, they are much less likely to use them. Without a web application showing all the public safety services in a neighborhod, the public may continue to try and access help from the wrong, or an insufficient, resource.  </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Proposal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> The Toronto general public can access mutliple data sets related to public safety for their neighbourhood in a single web mapping application. We want to provide a more cohesive, single, web map which contains more information. This will include: Police Facilities, Medical Facilities, Fire Response Facilities. </p>
